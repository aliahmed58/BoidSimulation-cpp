# Boids - Flocking Behaviour Simulation

## Introduction
An artifical life simulation originally developed by Craig Reynolds. The simulation aims to explain the behaviour of flocking birds. This simulation explains if how a single boid (bird) follows some certain rules, leads to a flocking behaviour among multiple boids.

Each boid follows three very simple rules:

1. **Seperation**: boids keep certain distance and move away from boids that get too close.
2. **Cohesion**: boids average the velocity of other boids in certain distance and try to match that velocity.
3. **Cohesion**: boids average the position of other boids in certain distance and move towards the center.

For implementation and other various details, see the [tutorial here](https://vanhunteradams.com/Boids/Boids.html)
